    <!--This color has been added for text elements in the detail activity/fragment. An alpha
    value of 87% has been used according to the guidance in the MD specs:

    https://material.io/guidelines/style/typography.html#typography-other-typographic-guidelines

    It is used on text that has the "Headline" and "Subheading" MD style applied. This color is used
    for text where there are dark/high contrast backgrounds (such as the meta bar) and a white color
    is used in order to make the text more legible. Although the MD specs outline alpha values for
    black text, I assumed that the same alpha values would apply for white text as well. The
    MD specs also provide guidance on when it is appropriate to switch from black to white text
    (such as when dark backgrounds are present).-->
